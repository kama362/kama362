## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is [taimoor], and I am currently a student at APTECH. I am learning web development, focusing on three core technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of building web pages. I am learning how to structure content on the web, creating elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) helps me to style and layout web pages. I am gaining skills to make websites look visually appealing by using colors, fonts, and responsive layouts.

JavaScript is the programming language that I am using to make web pages interactive. I am learning how to add functionality, such as event handling, form validation, and animations, to enhance user experience.

I am excited to continue my learning journey at APTECH and develop the skills necessary to create modern and functional websites.
